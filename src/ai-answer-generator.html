      <h2>FAQ: Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>

      <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing
        tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning,
        perception, and understanding natural language.
      </p>

      <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
      <p>
        AI works by using algorithms and computational models to process data and make decisions. Machine learning, a
        subset of AI, involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or
        decisions based on new data.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the different types of AI?</h3>
      <h4>AI can be categorized into three main types:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Narrow AI: Also known as weak AI, this type is designed to perform a specific task, such as image
          recognition or language translation. Most current AI applications fall into this category.
        </li>
        <li>General AI: Also known as strong AI, this type would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply
          knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. This level of AI does not yet exist.
        </li>
        <li>Superintelligent AI: This hypothetical type would surpass human intelligence in all aspects, including
          creativity and problem-solving. It remains a topic of speculation and research.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or
        decisions based on data. It can be divided into several types, including supervised learning, unsupervised
        learning, and reinforcement learning.
      </p>

      <h3>What is deep learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to
        analyze and learn from large amounts of data. It's particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech
        recognition.
      </p>

      <h3>What are neural networks?</h3>
      <p>
        Neural networks are a type of computational model inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected
        nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information. Neural networks are fundamental to many AI and machine
        learning applications.
      </p>

      <h3>What is an AI answer generator?</h3>
